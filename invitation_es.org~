Dear YOU

My name is Adolfo and I am working leading the DataLab at Medialab-Prado (Madrid, Spain), an internationally well known public cultural center considered itself as a citizen driven laboratory which engage local communities with national and international people who are working on different topics.

I am currently organizing Visualizar'17, an international workshop focused on data visualization to tak place over the course of two weeks in September 2017. [[http://medialab-prado.es/visualizar][Visualizar]] celebrates its tenth anniversary with a workshop dedicated to [[http://s.coop/visualizar17][Migrations]], organized in collaboration with [[http://porcausa.org][PorCausa]].

The workshop was kickstarted in 2007 by José Luis de Vicente and this is my third edition as coordinator and the second as head officer of Datalab.

* Visualizar'17: Migrations

Medialab Prado's programme Visualizar (Visualise) celebrates its 10th anniversary with a workshop devoted to /Migrations/, organised in collaboration with PorCausa. Human migration is one of the meanings given for the word migration ("migración") in the Spanish dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy. However, the term thus covers a broad range of possible scenarios: spices, data and substances are also possible topics to work on.

We've had great visitors and collaborators like Ben Fry, Aaron Koblin, Stamen, Fernanda Viegas, Adam Greenfield, Bestiario, Adrian Holovaty, Sunlight Foundation, Mark Hansen, Manuel Lima, Dietmar Offenhuber, Amber Frid-Jimenez, Andrew Vande Moere, Greg Bloom, Sisi Wei, Yuri Engelhardt, Óscar Corcho, Alejandro Zappala, María Poveda, Daniel Vila Suero, Nandana Mihindukulasooriya, Ignasi Alcalde or Gonzalo Abril, among many others.

I was wondering if you were able to share your knowledge with us! There are several ways to do it but I will mention the two more common ways.

** Speaker

The easiest way is participating as speaker in the opening symposium, a two-day event where all the participants of the workshop, including leaders of projects and col.laborators- aim to find some interesting insights to enrich their projects

** Mentor
The most interesting way of participating is being one of the mentors of the workshop. This means to be with us at least the whole 15 days of the workshop, including a participation in the opening symposium and/or another activity as a workshop one of the days of work.

** Other

Maybe you very interested in the workshop or in the topic but you just have one week available... Maybe you know someone else who could be interested... Maybe you are leading an initiative which would be interested in other collaboration... Maybe you would like to know the results of the workshop to use it further... Please do not hesitate to ask or suggest any other way of collaboration.

* Feedback

How does it sound for you? Would you be able to stay in Madrid for the fortnight workshop or just fr the symposium?

By the way, we take care of the trip and the accomodation.

Looking forward to hearing from you

All the best!
